# 🚀 WorkLink

**WorkLink** is a monetization-first digital platform designed to help users **do business, learn, and earn money**, while ensuring long-term sustainability for the system itself.

The platform blends **earning opportunities, digital products, gifts, and a smart retention model** that benefits both users and the ecosystem.

## 🌍 Vision

To build a self-sustaining platform where users:
- Earn money through digital activities
- Access valuable content and products
- Reinvest part of their earnings back into the system
- Grow together with the platform

WorkLink is built for **scalability, retention, and long-term value**, not short-term payouts.

- Supports system sustainability through retention logic

### 🎁 Gifts

## 💸 Monetization Flow

1. User performs an earning activity
2. Earnings are credited to the wallet
3. A **percentage is automatically retained by the system**
4. The remaining balance is available to the user
5. Withdrawals follow minimum limits and time rules

This model ensures:
- Platform sustainability
- Reduced abuse
- Long-term growth

## 🔒 Retention & Sustainability Logic

- Part of user earnings remain inside the system
- Funds are reused for:
  - Unlocking new content
  - Gifts and rewards
  - Premium features
- Encourages users to stay active instead of cashing out instantly
